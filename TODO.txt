- rip/convert more tunes/sounds:
MUS_DK_ROAR     = 0x0f     | Zerbert. Zerbert. Zerbert: missing when gorilla at end of level!

- double buffering: fix switch screen, should be done at start, and inverted (?)
- bits of bobs left in double buffering mode on fast objects
  (probably logic error with previous positions)
- sparkles missing when kong crashes
- compute palettes per level, use current screen global variable
     (attract mode DONKEY KONG title is also a case)
     ok but missing color replacement for elevator sprite and other level 3
	 only sprites like bouncer

- mario walk seems not correct to the left
- test elevators & pie factory!
- fix kong "smart" display: looks ok
- four barrels redraw: almost ok
- four barrels redraw double buffering = draw twice
- fix CLI args
- elevator sprite colors are wrong
- pause

minor:

- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
