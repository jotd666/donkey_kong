- MUS_DK_ROAR  missing when gorilla at end of level
- level 2 sometimes glitches / frozen on A500 config
- test CLI args
- pause

minor:

- dual bob/sprite support (level 3 fires could be sprites)
- four barrels redraw: ok even if could be better optimized
- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
