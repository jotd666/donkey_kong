- barrels fall off screen / bounce in a bogus way / switch sprite
  from facing to side...
- flame rises without any ladder, also at rivets level
- jumps: takes hammer even if far away!
- hammer doesn't seem to destroy barrels
- insert coin: 00 => 01 then 00 again????
- blit reverse for y flip (kong falls)
- "50m" is shifted
- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- implement sounds (turn off music to rip)
- princess at rivets stage: wrong attributes: should be ok now
- rivets logically removed but not from screen, left part ok right not done, around 1a84
- level select!
- scoring remains at 0
