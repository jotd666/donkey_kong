- rip/convert more tunes/sounds:
MUS_DK_FALLS    = 0x0e     | Music when DK is about to fall in rivet stage
MUS_DK_ROAR     = 0x0f     | Zerbert. Zerbert. Zerbert: missing when gorilla at end of level!

- sparkles missing when kong crashes
- reduce to 4 bitplanes with sprites to save bandwidth
  => compute palettes per level, use current screen global variable
     (attract mode DONKEY KONG title is also a case)
     ok but missing color replacement for elevator sprite and other level 3
	 only sprites like bouncer
- add hardware sprites
- fix switch screen, should be done at start, and inverted (?)
- 25 Hz refresh (maybe possible to retain 50Hz with more blitter optims ex 
  not redrawing on Kong or on Princess if not in intro / screen 1!)
- fix CLI args
- pause

minor:

- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- elevator: colors slightly off (clarify with Mark)
- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
