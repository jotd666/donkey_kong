- log sprites that are displayed with clut (too many cluts): in progress
- flip X (aka Y in game): kong uses that, configure flip per tile to save memory
- demo: mario jumps & dies immediately from the fall! catch mario sprite when landing, see the code around
  check mario_lands_1c3a
- cookie cut doesn't seem to work for sprites or mask is bogus??
- implement cookie cut erase for sprites (2 first bitplanes) then normal erase for the rest
- implement insert coin
