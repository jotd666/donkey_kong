- if detects signature of one of the 3 kong params code+clut, then set a flag, prevent
  from displaying any kong sprites in that update and blit the big corresponding kong
  pic, saves a lot of blitting/masking
  => works for 1 frame, missing 2 others. Also don't do when kong 
  is "grinning" (intro)
   erase wrong
   x seems shifted: sub 16 to test
- optimize tile xy computation like in tetris
- blitter using blit chain (doesn't work properly in cycle exact, seems to crash)
- too slow on level 2 (cement factory) on a500
- sound priorities to check
- problem when too many sprites (barrels) even if bobs should be displayed
  after 8 sprites. Today this is eluded: if there's a problem then
  last sprite won't be displayed. Hoping it's not noticeable or better:
  reproduce it and fix it!
- music playing even in demo mode
- elevator speed too slow in 2P mode? generally 2P mode params copy seems buggy: losing level info?

Sometimes it starts you with 4 lives, sometimes with 3 lives.

When it starts you with 3 lives you gain extra life at 7k
After game-over, second game starts with 4 lives, no extra lives at 7k

This does not seem to be consistent
Using the latest WHDload version of the game.

I can only assume something is passed over from the previous game attempt, so I clipped 3 vids of when it happens, just in case there is any correlation between them.

minor:


- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
- up the display 8 pixels
- center display
