- hammer hits barrels but doesn't kill them
- elevators: mario doesn't stand on them falls through
- pie factory: moving ladders are completely off (color+Y)
- playing a while: score seems to have been reset
- implement sounds (turn off music to rip): test mode has sounds!!
- add double buffering
- "50m/75m/100m..." is shifted
- elevator/conveyors: colors are wrong
- highscore save
- implement dipswitches
- insert coin with fire, start with up/down
- pause
- fix level 22 kill screen: Like most kill screens, this kill screen is 
the result of integer overflow on an 8 bit variable. 
The amount of time allowed for any given screen is 
determined algorithmically during play by the level the player is on. The timer is calculated in seconds as 10×(level + 4), and has a maximum value of 80. When the level reaches 22, the game reads 10×(22+4) or 260 seconds. However, the 8-bit counter rolls over at 256, meaning the game calculates 4. This causes the timer to be set so low that there is 4 seconds for the player to complete the level, simply not enough time for the screen to possibly be completed
- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
