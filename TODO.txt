- MUS_DK_ROAR  missing when gorilla at end of level
- compute palettes per level, use current screen global variable
     (attract mode DONKEY KONG title is also a case)
- four barrels redraw: almost ok
- fix CLI args
- dual bob/sprite support (level 3 fires could be sprites)
- elevator sprite colors are wrong kludge?
- ladder sprite colors are wrong kludge?
- pause

minor:

- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
