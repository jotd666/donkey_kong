- barrels climb up slopes now if not taking a ladder!
  barrel_moves_laterally_1ff6? 
  theory: barrel bounce too high / far from girder and picks up higher girder
  and it doesn't bother the barrel to go up as the girder move routine is shared
  between mario, fireballs and barrels
* we arrive here because the barrel isn't going left, right, or down a ladder
* could be crazy barrel or barrel going over edge
l_2053:
  
- insert coin: 00 => 01 then 00 again????
- "50m/75m/100m..." is shifted
- hammer hits barrels but doesn't kill them
- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- implement sounds (turn off music to rip): test mode has sounds!!
- scoring remains at 0
- score sprites don't appear, ever, ex: removing rivet at l_1a9e
- elevators: mario doesn't stand on them falls through
- elevator/conveyors: color looks wrong
- pie factory: missing platforms/wrong platform types
- girders level fireball: wrong colors when going right (flashing)

- level start 2: 2nd screen is elevators
- level start 3: 2nd screen is pie factory
- fix level 22 kill screen: Like most kill screens, this kill screen is 
the result of integer overflow on an 8 bit variable. 
The amount of time allowed for any given screen is 
determined algorithmically during play by the level the player is on. The timer is calculated in seconds as 10×(level + 4), and has a maximum value of 80. When the level reaches 22, the game reads 10×(22+4) or 260 seconds. However, the 8-bit counter rolls over at 256, meaning the game calculates 4. This causes the timer to be set so low that there is 4 seconds for the player to complete the level, simply not enough time for the screen to possibly be completed
