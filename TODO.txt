- problem when too many sprites (barrels) even if bobs should be displayed
  after 8 sprites. Today this is eluded: if there's a problem then
  last sprite won't be displayed. Hoping it's not noticeable or better:
  reproduce it and fix it!
- On the Japanese version, a Barrel cannot drop down a ladder while Jumpman is on it (upper third).
  The change form SUBQ.B #4,D0 to SUB.B #$10,D0 make this possible. You can compare the MAME ROMS to check it: add cheat flag
- add CLI option for japan levels / japan ladder setup

minor:

- fmode=3 to save bandwidth in AGA
- four barrels redraw: ok even if could be better optimized
- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
- up the display 8 pixels
- center display


- check sounds on other games!
