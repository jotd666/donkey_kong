- sprites completely misplaced (only once) when jumping at stage 3
- hammer kills wrong firefox/pie (item_just_hit_1ea0 rivets level)
  ok for barrels & fire:
    index_of_item_hit_6354, offset_for_item_in_array_6353
	either explosion sprites is misplaced (but kills the proper flame)
	or properly placed but kills another one
- game over with highscore: almost nothing displayed, + highscore trashed
- pie factory: pies not erased at some point
- playing a while: score seems to have been reset (to confirm)
- start music not played (pattern 0)
- implement more sounds: gorilla screams, ...
- rip more tunes
- "50m/75m/100m..." is shifted
- elevator/conveyors: colors are wrong, lower elevator conveyors remain drawn
  maybe mask issue when drawing reverted sprites?
- implement dipswitches
- girders: barrels change color just before rolling into oil can
- insert coin with fire, start with up/down
- pause
- highscore save
- fix level 22 kill screen: Like most kill screens, this kill screen is 
the result of integer overflow on an 8 bit variable. 
The amount of time allowed for any given screen is 
determined algorithmically during play by the level the player is on. The timer is calculated in seconds as 10×(level + 4), and has a maximum value of 80. When the level reaches 22, the game reads 10×(22+4) or 260 seconds. However, the 8-bit counter rolls over at 256, meaning the game calculates 4. This causes the timer to be set so low that there is 4 seconds for the player to complete the level, simply not enough time for the screen to possibly be completed
- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
