- rip/convert more tunes/sounds:
MUS_DK_ROAR     = 0x0f     | Zerbert. Zerbert. Zerbert: missing when gorilla at end of level!


- sparkles missing when kong crashes: B9 , 1
- compute palettes per level, use current screen global variable
     (attract mode DONKEY KONG title is also a case)

- disable smart redraw when back of kong is displayed (check when erasing is OK)
- four barrels redraw: almost ok
- four barrels redraw double buffering = draw twice: to test
- hardcode disable smart redraw for converyor left to oil barrel (pie factory)
- fix CLI args
- elevator sprite colors are wrong
- pause

minor:

- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
