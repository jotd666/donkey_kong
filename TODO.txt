- rip/convert more tunes/sounds:
MUS_DK_ROAR     = 0x0f     | Zerbert. Zerbert. Zerbert: missing when gorilla at end of level!

- sparkles missing when kong crashes
- compute palettes per level, use current screen global variable
     (attract mode DONKEY KONG title is also a case)
     ok but missing color replacement for elevator sprite and other level 3
	 only sprites like bouncer

- problem with sprites (firefoxes) symmetry?? yflip?? test this
- test elevators & pie factory!
- fix kong "smart" display, maybe smart display of some kong tiles but not all
- four barrels redraw (clear flag) when barrel in the high left area or if kong
  is updated (hardcode this special case)
- four barrels redraw double buffering = draw twice
- double buffering: enable again then fix switch screen, should be done at start, and inverted (?)
- fix CLI args
- pause

minor:

- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- elevator: colors slightly off (clarify with Mark)
- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
