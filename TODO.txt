- problem when too many sprites (barrels) even if bobs should be displayed
  after 8 sprites. Today this is eluded: if there's a problem then
  last sprite won't be displayed. Hoping it's not noticeable or better:
  reproduce it and fix it!
- music playing even in demo mode
- elevator speed too slow in 2P mode? generally 2P mode params copy seems buggy: losing level info?
	move.b	framecounter_601a,d0            	| [$2709: ld      a,(framecounter_601a)] load A with this clock counts down from #FF to 00 over and over...
	move.b	level_number_6229,d7       	| [$2705: ld      a,(level_number_6229)] else load A with level number

- pause with joypad

Sometimes it starts you with 4 lives, sometimes with 3 lives.

When it starts you with 3 lives you gain extra life at 7k
After game-over, second game starts with 4 lives, no extra lives at 7k

This does not seem to be consistent
Using the latest WHDload version of the game.

I can only assume something is passed over from the previous game attempt, so I clipped 3 vids of when it happens, just in case there is any correlation between them.

minor:

- four barrels redraw: ok even if could be better optimized
- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
- up the display 8 pixels
- center display


- check sounds on other games!
