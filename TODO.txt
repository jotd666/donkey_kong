- barrels climb up slopes now (but ok barrels)
- mario sees every ladder as broken now (check 1b25)
- insert coin: 00 => 01 then 00 again????
- blit reverse for y flip (kong falls)
- "50m/75m/100m..." is shifted
- hammer hits barrels but doesn't kill them
- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- implement sounds (turn off music to rip)
- level select: level_number_6229
- scoring remains at 0
- score sprites don't appear, ever, ex: removing rivet at l_1a9e
- elevators: mario doesn't stand on them falls through
- elevator color looks wrong
- bonus does not decrease fast enough
