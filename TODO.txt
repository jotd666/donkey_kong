- highscore insertion seems wrong: score wrongly inserted
  then changes after entering it!
- rip/convert more tunes/sounds:
MUS_OUTATIME    = 0x03     | Running out of time
MUS_25M         = 0x08     | Music for barrel stage
MUS_100M        = 0x0b     | Music for rivet stage
MUS_DK_FALLS    = 0x0e     | Music when DK is about to fall in rivet stage
MUS_DK_ROAR     = 0x0f     | Zerbert. Zerbert. Zerbert: missing when gorilla at end of level!

- implement dipswitches
- insert coin with fire, start with up/down
- pause
- skip blank tiles like 0x70: no! it's to remove the 2 girders on top!
- elevator: colors slightly off (clarify with Mark)
