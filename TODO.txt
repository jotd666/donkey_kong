- problem when too many sprites (barrels) even if bobs should be displayed
  after 8 sprites. Today this is eluded: if there's a problem then
  last sprite won't be displayed. Hoping it's not noticeable or better:
  reproduce it and fix it!

minor:

- four barrels redraw: ok even if could be better optimized
- dipswitches extra life at 7000 ...
- up the display 8 pixels
- center display


- check sounds on other games!
