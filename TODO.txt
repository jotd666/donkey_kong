- last copper lines not correct: debug with color 0 instead of color 3, go beyond PAL limit
- implement sprites: log sprites that are displayed with clut (too many cluts)
- demo doesn't seem to run (timer not decreasing)
- implement insert coin



- if possible, use 13-color BOB palette (black OK, then 3 varying colors that can't be used)
